            In the contemporary era, the pervasive impact of plastic pollution has reached unprecedented levels, extending beyond visible waste to the realm of nanoscale particles. Among these, nano-plastics, minute plastic particles with dimensions measured in nanometers, have emerged as a pressing environmental concern. As these tiny fragments infiltrate the Earth's atmosphere, the consequences for ecosystems, human health, and the overall well-being of the planet are increasingly significant.

            This seminar aims to delve into the intricate dynamics of nano-plastics in the atmosphere, exploring their sources, distribution, and potential ramifications. We will navigate through the scientific landscape, addressing key questions surrounding the behavior of nano-plastics in the air, their pathways, and the challenges posed by their omnipresence. From shedding light on the atmospheric transport mechanisms to investigating the implications for ecological systems, this discussion seeks to unravel the complexities associated with nano-plastics and foster a comprehensive understanding of their atmospheric impact.
